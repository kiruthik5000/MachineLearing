# Machine Learning

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models, ranging from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations. It is designed to be a valuable resource for anyone looking to learn and apply machine learning techniques.

## Prerequisites

To make the most of this repository, it is recommended that you have a solid understanding of the following:

* **Python 3+**: All models are implemented in Python. Familiarity with Python syntax, data structures, and object-oriented programming is essential.
* **Mathematics Concepts**: A foundational understanding of key mathematical concepts is crucial for comprehending the underlying principles of machine learning algorithms. Specifically:
    * **Linear Algebra**:
        * **Vectors**: Understanding vector operations (addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product), vector spaces, and their geometric interpretations.
        * **Matrices**: Basic matrix operations (addition, multiplication, transpose, inverse), determinants, and eigenvalues/eigenvectors. These are fundamental for understanding data representation and transformations in many ML algorithms.
    * **Calculus**:
        * **Derivatives**: Understanding derivatives, partial derivatives, and gradients is essential for optimization algorithms used in training machine learning models (e.g., gradient descent).
    * **Statistics and Probability**:
        * **Basic Statistics**: Concepts like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and correlation.
        * **Probability Distributions**: Understanding common distributions like normal (Gaussian) distribution, binomial distribution, and their properties.
        * **Hypothesis Testing**: Basic understanding of hypothesis testing and p-values can be helpful for evaluating model performance.
    * **Regression**: A core statistical and machine learning concept. Understanding:
        * **Linear Regression**: The basic principles of fitting a line to data, understanding coefficients, residuals, and metrics like R-squared.
        * **Types of Regression**: Familiarity with other regression types (e.g., polynomial regression, logistic regression) will be beneficial as you progress.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each dedicated to a specific machine learning topic or type of model. Within each directory, you will find:

* **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)**: Interactive notebooks explaining the theory, implementation, and application of the models.
* **Python Scripts (.py)**: Standalone Python scripts for specific model implementations or utility functions.
* **Datasets**: Sample datasets used in the examples (or links to external datasets).
