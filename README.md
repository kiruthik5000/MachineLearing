# ðŸ§  Handwritten Digit Recognition Model (MNIST)

This project contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow/Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The model is trained on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which consists of 70,000 grayscale images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing) of handwritten digits (0â€“9), each sized 28Ã—28 pixels.
